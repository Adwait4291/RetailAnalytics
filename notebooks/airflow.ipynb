    "🛠️ Setting Up Apache Airflow with Python – Step-by-Step with Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup installs Apache Airflow using version-specific dependency constraints to ensure compatibility, starts a standalone instance, and prepares your first DAG folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Step 1: Set Airflow home directory\n",
    "\n",
    "export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "Sets an environment variable AIRFLOW_HOME which tells Airflow where to store its files — such as logs, configuration, and the default database. It defaults to ~/airflow, but you can change it if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Step 2: Define Airflow and Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "AIRFLOW_VERSION=3.0.2\n",
    "PYTHON_VERSION=\"$(python -c 'import sys; print(f\"{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\")')\"\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "\t•\tAIRFLOW_VERSION specifies the version of Airflow you want to install.\n",
    "\t•\tPYTHON_VERSION dynamically fetches your current Python version (like 3.10) — which is required because Airflow has different dependency constraints for different Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Step 3: Create the URL for version-specific dependency constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "CONSTRAINT_URL=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-${AIRFLOW_VERSION}/constraints-${PYTHON_VERSION}.txt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "Builds a URL pointing to Airflow’s official constraint file. This file lists compatible versions of libraries required by that specific version of Airflow, ensuring a stable and conflict-free installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Step 4: Install Airflow using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install \"apache-airflow==${AIRFLOW_VERSION}\" --constraint \"${CONSTRAINT_URL}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "Installs Apache Airflow with version-locked dependencies using the constraint file you just built. This prevents common installation issues caused by incompatible packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 Step 5: Run Airflow in standalone mode\n",
    "\n",
    "airflow standalone\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "Starts Airflow in a simplified mode ideal for local testing. It launches:\n",
    "\t•\tthe scheduler\n",
    "\t•\tthe web server (by default at http://localhost:8080)\n",
    "\t•\tinitializes the database\n",
    "\t•\tcreates a default admin user\n",
    "\n",
    "It will print the username/password you can use to log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "📁 Step 6: Create a DAGs folder if it doesn’t exist\n",
    "\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/airflow/dags\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "Creates a folder called dags inside your Airflow home. This is where all your DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Python files will be stored and picked up by the Airflow scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 Step 7: Create your first DAG file\n",
    "\n",
    "nano ~/airflow/dags/retail_ml_demo_dag.py\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 What this does:\n",
    "Opens the nano text editor (you can use any editor) to create your first DAG Python file. Example DAG contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "from airflow import DAG\n",
    "from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello from Retail ML DAG!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "with DAG(\n",
    "    dag_id='retail_ml_demo_dag',\n",
    "    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),\n",
    "    schedule_interval='@daily',\n",
    "    catchup=False\n",
    ") as dag:\n",
    "    task = PythonOperator(\n",
    "        task_id='hello_task',\n",
    "        python_callable=print_hello\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "🗂️ Save this in ~/airflow/dags/retail_ml_demo_dag.py. It will automatically appear in your Airflow UI under DAGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
