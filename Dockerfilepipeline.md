# ML Pipeline Dockerfile Configuration

This Dockerfile creates the ML Pipeline container for the Retail ML application, responsible for data processing, model training, and model management operations.

## Dockerfile.pipeline

```dockerfile
FROM retail-ml-base:latest
```
Inherits from the custom base image `retail-ml-base:latest`, which provides:
- Python 3.12-slim foundation
- Common dependencies and system packages
- Security configurations with non-root user
- Critical environment variables (`DOCKER_CONTAINER=true`, `PYTHONPATH=/app`)

### Temporary Root Access for Setup

```dockerfile
USER root
```
Temporarily switches to root user for directory creation and file copying operations that require elevated permissions.

### Source Code and Configuration

```dockerfile
COPY --chown=app:app src/ /app/src/
COPY --chown=app:app .env /app/.env
```
Copies essential files with proper ownership:
- `src/`: Contains the ML pipeline source code, training modules, and data processing scripts
- `.env`: Environment configuration file with MongoDB credentials and cluster information
- `--chown=app:app`: Ensures files are owned by the non-root `app` user for security

### Directory Structure Setup

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /app/models /app/data/raw /app/data/processed && \
    chown -R app:app /app/models /app/data
```
Creates the required directory structure:
- `/app/models`: Storage for trained models, scalers, and feature artifacts
- `/app/data/raw`: Input data storage for processing
- `/app/data/processed`: Cleaned and processed data storage
- `chown -R app:app`: Ensures proper ownership for the non-root user

### Security Restoration

```dockerfile
USER app
```
Switches back to the non-root `app` user for all subsequent operations, maintaining security best practices.

### Environment Configuration

```dockerfile
ENV MODEL_DIR=/app/models
```
Sets the model directory path explicitly:
- **Critical for Docker environment**: Ensures consistent model path resolution
- **Works with path conversion logic**: Complements the `DOCKER_CONTAINER=true` from base image
- **Volume mapping compatibility**: Aligns with docker-compose volume configuration

### Health Monitoring

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
    CMD python -c "import sys; sys.exit(0)" || exit 1
```
Implements container health monitoring:
- `--interval=30s`: Checks health every 30 seconds
- `--timeout=10s`: Each health check times out after 10 seconds
- `--start-period=60s`: Allows 60 seconds for container initialization
- `--retries=3`: Marks container as unhealthy after 3 consecutive failures
- **Simple Python test**: Verifies Python interpreter and basic functionality

### Container Startup

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "-m", "src.pipeline"]
```
Defines the default command to execute when the container starts:
- Runs the pipeline module as a Python package
- Executes the main pipeline orchestration logic
- Handles data processing, model training, and artifact storage

## Pipeline Functionality

### Core Responsibilities
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and processes raw retail data
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates features for machine learning models
- **Model Training**: Trains Random Forest and other ML models
- **Model Evaluation**: Validates model performance and metrics
- **Artifact Storage**: Saves models, scalers, and metadata to shared volumes
- **Database Updates**: Updates MongoDB with model metadata and results

### Volume Integration
Works with docker-compose volumes:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data          # Local data access
  - models:/app/models        # Shared model storage
```

### Environment Variables
Inherits and uses:
- `DOCKER_CONTAINER=true`: For environment detection
- `MODEL_DIR=/app/models`: For consistent model paths
- `PYTHONPATH=/app`: For module imports
- MongoDB credentials from `.env` file

## Usage in Docker Compose

```yaml
ml-pipeline:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.pipeline
  container_name: retail_24-ml-pipeline-1
  volumes:
    - ./data:/app/data
    - models:/app/models
  environment:
    - DOCKER_CONTAINER=true
    - MODEL_DIR=/app/models
    # MongoDB credentials...
  depends_on:
    - mongodb
  restart: unless-stopped
```

## Pipeline Execution Flow

1. **Container Startup**: Initializes environment and dependencies
2. **Data Loading**: Reads raw data from `/app/data/raw`
3. **Data Processing**: Cleans and prepares data in `/app/data/processed`
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creates ML-ready features
5. **Model Training**: Trains models with cross-validation
6. **Model Evaluation**: Calculates performance metrics
7. **Artifact Storage**: Saves models to `/app/models` (shared volume)
8. **Database Updates**: Updates MongoDB with model metadata
9. **Pipeline Completion**: Marks models as active and available

## Directory Structure

```

â””â”€â”€ .env                   # Environment configuration
```

## Health Check Details

The health check serves multiple purposes:
- **Container Status**: Monitors if the container is responsive
- **Python Environment**: Verifies Python interpreter functionality
- **Orchestration**: Helps docker-compose manage container lifecycle
- **Debugging**: Provides visibility into container health status

Check health status:
```bash
docker inspect retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 | grep Health -A 5
```

## Security Features

- **Non-root execution**: All operations run as `app` user
- **Proper file ownership**: Files are owned by the non-root user
- **Minimal privileges**: Only necessary permissions are granted
- **Environment isolation**: Credentials are passed via environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Execution Issues
```bash
# Check pipeline logs
docker-compose logs ml-pipeline

# Access container for debugging
docker exec -it retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 bash

# Verify directory structure
docker exec retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 ls -la /app
```

### Permission Problems
```bash
# Check file ownership
docker exec retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 ls -la /app/models

# Verify user context
docker exec retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 whoami
```

### Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# Check environment variables
docker exec retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 printenv | grep -E "(DOCKER|MODEL|MONGO)"
```

### Health Check Failures
```bash
# Manual health check
docker exec retail_24-ml-pipeline-1 python -c "import sys; print('Python OK')"

# Check container status
docker-compose ps
```

## Building and Deployment

```bash
# Build the pipeline image
docker-compose build ml-pipeline

# Run pipeline only
docker-compose up ml-pipeline

# Run with logs
docker-compose up ml-pipeline --no-deps
```

This container is designed to work seamlessly with the Streamlit application, sharing model artifacts through Docker volumes for real-time predictions and dashboard updates.
